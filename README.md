# Light Fighter Manifesto

Light Fighter Manifesto is a veteran-owned publication focused on practical skills, self-reliance, and adaptable thinking. We share knowledge from subject matter experts across survival, communications, autonomous systems, fabrication, and operational security.

*Unfiltered. Uncensored. Unconventional.*
